the purpose of TBANewCustom is to record the json file, so we don't have to fetch every time and is nto useless, but very usefull in google sheets
in order to replicate the use in code, instead of having TBATeamInfo(), TBAEventStatus, TBA_TeamFullInfo(team),TBA_GetCurMatch(match) return the fetch every time:
it should be a var recording to json file to prevent having to fetch over and over

def GetBlueTeams #is this wrong casue returns 3 teams, how to split 
def GetRedTeams #is this wrong casue returns 3 teams, how to split
#we need to use the bottom middle and top rows to find the specific amount of cube points scord, and telopgamepeicepoint-cube = cone

response:
We don't have to worry about the GetTeam methods, we can easily take the [index] of the output and get what team we want from each alliances

We will keep TBANewCustom (locator) as a method however you can just do fetchedJson[location][sublocation][subsublocation]... which will yield the same result 
the only reason why we had this was because we were calling methods inside the spreadhseet, which doesn't allow for [] notation to get sublocations, we are not
doing this here so we don't really need this 

As for calling methods multiple times with the methods in question, either way, they will need to be called multiple times. Remember, we are fetching from webadresses, 
the parameter inside the Address Fetchers are not json locations so you can't just have a parent variable that stores the fetch for "team/frc/team" and then do variable[simple],
that's not how webadresses work

As for goals for next time, there are listed below as such in no particular order:

1. We have NOT written anything to actually write the prints to the spreadsheet, this may invovled some refactoring
2. We have NOT done OPR & cube/cone points yet 

Perhpas it's a good idea to split up and each person focuses on one thing

I added
TBA_EventOPR
TBA_EventDPR
TBA_EventCCWM
and changed the name of TBA-Functions to TBA_Functions
