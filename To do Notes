the purpose of TBANewCustom is to record the json file, so we don't have to fetch every time and is nto useless, but very usefull in google sheets
in order to replicate the use in code, instead of having TBATeamInfo(), TBAEventStatus, TBA_TeamFullInfo(team),TBA_GetCurMatch(match) return the fetch every time:
it should be a var recording to json file to prevent having to fetch over and over
