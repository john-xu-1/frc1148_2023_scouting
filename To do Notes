the purpose of TBANewCustom is to record the json file, so we don't have to fetch every time and is nto useless, but very usefull in google sheets
in order to replicate the use in code, instead of having TBATeamInfo(), TBAEventStatus, TBA_TeamFullInfo(team),TBA_GetCurMatch(match) return the fetch every time:
it should be a var recording to json file to prevent having to fetch over and over

def GetBlueTeams #is this wrong casue returns 3 teams, how to split
def GetRedTeams #is this wrong casue returns 3 teams, how to split
#we need to use the bottom middle and top rows to find the specific amount of cube points scord, and telopgamepeicepoint-cube = cone
